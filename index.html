      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>An Enneagram 1w2, Chris is driven by principle. He eschews coffee for tea, punctuating his days with steamy mugs of Japanese green&mdash;<a href="http://mellowmonk.com/buyGreenTea.htm" target="_blank">a fine fukamushi sencha</a> to be exact. When he doesn't have his nose in a five-star self-improvement book, he finds his bliss behind the keyboard of his MacBook Pro 16", writing code. Chris thinks LA is way too sunny, and he throws an error when his broadband is out.</p>
